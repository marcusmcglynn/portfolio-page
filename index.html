            with a background in music. I specialize in JavaScript, HTML, CSS,
            and have experience building user-focused, responsive interfaces. My
            portfolio showcases a variety of front-end projects, where I've

        <p>
          Hi, I'm a musician-turned-developer with a passion for combining
          creativity and technical expertise. With a strong foundation in
          precision and attention to detail from my musical background, I've
          developed a unique ability to approach problems from multiple angles
          and communicate complex ideas in a clear and concise manner. As
          someone who's spent years honing their skills as a performer and
          composer, I bring a level of dedication and perseverance that serves
          me well in the world of software development.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm excited to explore new opportunities where I can apply my skills
          and experience to drive innovation and deliver exceptional results. If
          you're looking for a collaborative team player who is passionate about
          creating high-quality software solutions, please feel free to take a

          don't hesitate to reach out. I'm always looking for ways to improve
          and expand my skills, and I appreciate any feedback that can help me

            As a composer and developer, I created an MP3 player app built with
            JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The app features button controls for easy
            navigation and playback of my own original music, allowing users to
            enjoy my compositions in a unique and interactive way. By combining
            my passion for music with my expertise in web development, I aimed
            to create a seamless listening experience that showcases my artistic
            vision.

          <h3>Darts App</h3>
          <p>
            As a developer with a passion for darts, I created [App Name], a
            scoring app designed to make tracking scores and keeping track of
            progress easy and intuitive. With buttons for each number on the
            board, as well as common score shortcuts like 180 and 140, this app
            is perfect for both casual players and serious enthusiasts. The
            addition of single, double, and treble modifier buttons provides an
            extra layer of realism, even if you don't always manage to hit them
            (let's be honest, getting a 180 every time would be amazing). Built
            with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, [App Name] is a reliable tool for
            any darts player looking to take their game to the next level.
